  ## Usage
  Welcome to Pigskin Pachanga (Pigskin Party), your go-to destination for a fantasy football league and team generator! Upon visiting the site, you’ll see the header, navbar, and site name at the top, with the logo prominently displayed alongside a football field and stadium lights. To get started, click the Login button to create an account or log in; any other button will redirect you to the login page, where you can enter your email and password or click Sign Up to create a new account with a username, email, and password. Once logged in, you’ll access the Dashboard, featuring your username and email on the left, a list of your teams with an option to create a new one, and a list of leagues you belong to on the right, along with options to create or delete teams and leagues. The Draft page allows you to select a team from a dropdown menu and use React-Select to filter through over 1,000 players by typing their names, enabling you to draft or remove players easily. The Match-Up page, intended for weekly head-to-head competitions, currently displays a "Coming Soon" sign due to development constraints. Finally, you can log out using the Logout option when you’re ready to leave.
